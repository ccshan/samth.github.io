</li>
</ul>


Matthias Felleisen wrote the following paragraph to explain the choice of committee:
<blockquote>
Sam's thesis is about the design of Typed Scheme, a programming
language facilitating the porting of untyped Scheme programs to typed
code on a module-by-module basis.  All members of the committee have
experience with type systems and with Scheme.  Guy Steele is the
co-inventor of Scheme, and has been involved in the design and
implementation of numerous typed and untyped programming languages.
Mitch Wand and Olin Shivers have both developed static analyses for
Scheme, and Mitch Wand has also developed a type system for Scheme.

<h2>The Proposal</h2>
<p>
The thesis proposal: <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/samth/proposal.pdf">Typed Scheme</a>
</p>

The abstract:
<p>
Programming languages has recently experienced a renaissance,
especially in the field of untyped scripting languages.  But when
scripts written in untyped languages grow large, they may also grow
difficult to maintain. To improve the maintainability of untyped
language programs, we propose porting portions of them into typed
languages.  To validate the feasability of this approach, we have
developed Typed Scheme, a typed sister language to PLT Scheme.  Typed
Scheme provides smooth and sound interoperability with untyped PLT
Scheme.  It features a type system that supports idiomatic Scheme
programming, so that the porting process is relatively
straightforward.
