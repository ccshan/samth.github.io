This book (well, pre-book, at this point) is an introduction to
programming in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org). It's intentionally
aimed at people who already know how to program.  There are many
excellent ways to learn programming if you don't already know how; I
personally recommend [How to Design Programs](http://htdp.org).

Let's start right in with some code:

@
;; Is n prime?
(define (is-prime? n)
  (for/and ([i (in-range 2 n)])
     (not (zero? (modulo n i)))))
@

This function, called @is-prime?@, implements a rather inefficient
primality test.  We simply iterate over all the numbers between @2@
and @n@, and check if any of them is a factor of @n@.
